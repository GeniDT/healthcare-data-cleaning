# Cleaning Messy Healthcare Data Using Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and standardizing messy healthcare data using Python. By addressing typical data issues such as inconsistent date formats, missing values, and incorrect capitalization, the project ensures data readiness for analysis and visualization.

## Key Objectives
- Identify and handle missing values effectively.
- Standardize date formats to ensure uniformity.
- Clean and organize categorical data, including medications.
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** *(optional, for future use)*: For potential future visual exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset "raw_healthcare_data" used in this project provides healthcare-related information such as patient names, ages,Â visit dates, medications, and laboratory readings. It is stored as a CSV file.

## Key Steps in Data Cleaning
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Imputed missing dates, ages, and laboratory readings using appropriate techniques.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns created during intermediate processing.

2. **Standardizing Dates**:
   - Applied a custom function to convert various date formats into a consistent `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Reformatted medication names to follow proper case capitalization.
   - Mapped medications to their respective conditions correctly addressing any inconsistencies.
   - Checked and corrected non-numeric values into numeric values.

4. **Validation**:
   - Verified the integrity and consistency of the cleaned dataset.

## Project Highlights
- **Custom Function for Dates**: Handles multiple formats seamlessly.
- **Scalable Code**: Functions are reusable and adaptable to other datasets.
- **Documentation**: Includes detailed explanations for each cleaning step.
